📊 Python & NumPy Minor Project (Google Colab)
📌 Project Overview

This repository contains my Mini or Minor Project implemented using Python and NumPy, developed and executed entirely on Google Colab.
The objective of this project is to strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals, NumPy array operations, and basic problem-solving logic by building a complete, working program from scratch.

This project strictly follows academic guidelines and uses only concepts covered in class. No advanced libraries or frameworks are used.

🎯 Objectives

The main goals of this project are:

To apply core Python programming concepts in a practical way

To understand how NumPy arrays simplify numerical operations

To improve logical thinking and structured coding

To gain confidence in writing programs independently

To practice writing clean, readable, and explainable code

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

NumPy

Google Colab (for development and execution)

📂 Project Features

Depending on the selected problem statement, this project includes:

User input handling using input()

Menu-driven program flow

Use of lists and NumPy arrays

Mathematical computations using NumPy functions

Conditional statements for decision-making

Loops for repetitive operations

User-defined functions for modular code

Proper error handling (such as division by zero)

Clear output formatting

🧠 Concepts Covered

This project uses only allowed topics, including:

Python Basics

Variables and data types

Arithmetic operators

Conditional statements (if, elif, else)

for and while loops

Functions

Lists

NumPy

Creating arrays using numpy.array

Basic array operations

Mathematical operations on arrays

Functions like sum(), mean(), max(), min()

Indexing and slicing

📏 Academic Integrity

This project is entirely written using my own logic

No AI tools or auto code generators were used

Code is understandable and explainable line by line

Only class-approved topics are implemented

🏁 Conclusion

This project helped me build a strong foundation in Python and NumPy by focusing on logic first, then implementation.
It improved my confidence in writing structured programs and prepared me for more advanced projects in the future.
